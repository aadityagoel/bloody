							<p class="content-para">Despite the increase in the number of donors, blood remains in short supply during emergencies, mainly attributed to the lack of information and accessibility. We positively believe this tool can overcome most of these challenges by effectively connecting the blood donors with the blood recipients. We remind every visitor that we have the empowerment to save lives and let’s do that – right now, right here. If you are eligible for blood donation, please register yourself as a blood donor now! </p>
							<p>We also take this opportunity to thank our whole team for all your ideas, commitment and hard-ship in making this dream a reality. We would also like to thank our friends and well-wishers for all your support and encouragement throughout this project. It is now reasonably safe to say that together we have made this society a slightly better and safer place to live.</p>
